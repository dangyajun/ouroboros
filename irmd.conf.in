### Example Ouroboros configuration file
#
# This file contains a summary of current machine configuration
# options for the O7s prototype. The IRMd will attempt to load its
# configuration file during startup from the file
# @OUROBOROS_CONFIG_DIR@@OUROBOROS_CONFIG_FILE@.
#
# At the top level, it accepts configuration of
# services via the "name" directive, and configuration of the network
# specifying different IPCPs in the system. So, the list of accepted
# top level stanza is:
#
# [name.<name of service>] add a new name to the system.
# [local.<name for IPCP>] add a new local IPCP to the system.
# [eth-llc.<name for IPCP>] add a new IPCP over Ethernet (LLC) to the system.
# [eth-dix.<name for IPCP>] add a new IPCP over Ethernet (DIX) to the system.
# [eth-udp.<name for IPCP>] add a new IPCP over UDP/IPv4 to the system.
# [broadcast.<name of IPCP>] add a new broadcast IPCP to the system.
# [unicast.<name of IPCP>] add a new unicast IPCP to the system.
#
# Options for names:
#
# A name can be created without any parameters. The following options will
# allow more useful configurations:
# prog: bind programs to this name. Whenever an instance of one of these
#       programs is started, it will accept incoming flows for this name.
# args: When provided the program at the same index in the prog list will be
#       automatically started if there is an incoming flow for that name.
# lb:   Load-balancing option, if there are multiple processes accepting flows
#       for that name, the flow will get assigned to the process according to
#       the specified load-balancing algorithm.
#
# Options for IPCPs:
#
# bootstrap=<layer_name>: Immediately bootstrap this IPCP in this layer.
# enrol=<dst>:            Enrol with this neigbor (broadcast and unicast only).
# conn=[<dst>]:           Create mgmt and data flows with these neighbors.
# reg=[<names>]:          Register these names with the IPCP.
# Bootstrap options can be set as in the examples below.
# For more details on the configuration options for each of the IPCP types,
# please refer to the Ouroboros man page.
